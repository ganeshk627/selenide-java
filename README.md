# Introduction to Selenide
Selenide is a robust and user-friendly framework for test automation, primarily used for web application testing. It is built on top of Selenium WebDriver and enhances Selenium by providing a more concise API, automatic waiting, and easier handling of web elements, making it a preferred choice for many automation engineers.

# Key Features of Selenide:
1. **Web Testing**: Selenide excels in automating web applications. It simplifies the process of interacting with web elements, managing browser sessions, and handling synchronization issues, making web UI testing more efficient and reliable.
2. **Mobile Web Testing**: While Selenide is primarily designed for web testing, it can also be used to test mobile web applications. By configuring browser emulation or running tests on real mobile devices via cloud services like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs, Selenide can help ensure that your web application works well across different mobile devices and browsers.
3. **API Testing**: Selenide itself is not designed for API testing. For API testing, tools like RestAssured, Postman, or similar are more suitable. However, Selenide can be integrated with API testing frameworks within the same test suite, allowing you to perform UI and API tests in tandem.
4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Selenide supports all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Safari. It allows you to run tests across different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility of your web application.

# Language Support:
Selenide is primarily a Java-based framework. It supports Java and other JVM languages like Kotlin and Scala. The focus on the Java ecosystem makes it a good fit for teams already using Java for development or testing, and it integrates seamlessly with popular build tools like Maven and Gradle.
- **Java**: The primary language for Selenide. Most of the documentation and examples are in Java.
- **Kotlin**: Selenide works well with Kotlin, a modern and concise JVM language.
- **Scala**: Selenide can also be used with Scala, although it is less common.
